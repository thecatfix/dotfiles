# Welcome To My dotfiles page!

This page will be for your enjoyment in the begining as figure out what the hell I am doing with the zee dot file.

I hate dotfiles more than anything. They are confusing, unruly, bossy and flat out rude. So I am going to try to keep a journal of what I used on this journey.

However, after working with Neovim, Ghostty, ZSH and OhMyZSH the past couple of days I came to the conclusion that I need to use version control on the insane amount of changes I have been making.

## Features 

**XDG-compliant!** 💪🏽
(what does XDG stand for? GOOD QUESTION bc if you do know then run away from this repository as fast as you can! You will be wasting hours of your life trying to clean up my mistakes and probably making comments on the discussions form I setup on this page. 
If you don't know what XDG stands for then welcome to my personal learning journey that sometimes felt like chewing glass might be a better option. XDG is a total nightmare!)

**Zsh with Oh My Zsh’s pygmalion theme.**

**Neovim with Python 3.13.3 virtualenv for plugin support.**
